***What is the most popular day of rental***

![]()

Most of the people rent movie on Tuesday. About 30% rentals on Tuesday and Sunday.
It is likely that anyone who rents a movie will not rent it the next day either. Should check what the average sequel to renting a movie is

***What is the average days of rent movie***

The avg is 5.5 days for rent. I check correlation between number of days and price. I found that the r=0.5 there is a middle positive connection between two params. 
25% of the price is explained by the number of rental days but 75% is explained by other factors.


I recommend the company to limit the number of rental days to 5 days so that they can increase the number of rental on other days. In order to increase the income they should charge a higher price for rentals exceeding 5 days. In additiion to encouraging customers to make rentals on the weak days for example by specials


***What is the popular movie***
The most popular movie is 103 by 34 numbers of rental. His category is Travel.
Does travel is the most popular category? No. I found that the most popular category is Sports with 1179 times for rental.

I checked if there is a conection between those two question. I checked who are the actores play in the most popular moovies? perhaps
the customers choose thier moovie by the actors.
The most popular actors are . They are indeed play in 2 or 3 populars moovies.

Who are the actors that paly in sports movies and action movies?

***Most popular caategory by country***
The most popular category is Sports. In Brazil, sports movies are watched the most
I recommend the company to adjust thier movies by country or area in order to increase its customers in each country. 
i.e. more action movies in India, more sports movies in Brazil and more
